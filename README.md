TaskEm was a learning project about native Apple development using Swift and other Apple-based Libraries. The app itself is just a cool little daily task tracker. This project taught me everything it takes to build a native iOS/macOS application from scratch. 
The project taught me a lot about the limitations and benefits of developing an app natively vs. using something like Flutter.
