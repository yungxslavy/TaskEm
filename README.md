TaskEm was a learning project about native Apple development using Swift and other Apple-based Libraries. The app itself is a just a cool little daily task tracker (task trackers are cliche ik ik). This project taught me everything it takes to build a native iOS/macOS application from scratch. 
The project taught me a lot about the limitations and benefits of natively developing an app vs using something like Flutter. 

The project served its purpose, but out of passion and my weird completionist mentality, I wanted to finish this project and release it to the App Store for personal use (and it's always cool to show people your "app"). However, due to School/Work/Life ramping back up, this project was left unfinished.

Now, the project serves as a reminder and showcase of what I have learned. 

Thank you for checking it out!
